# libyt Documents Development

## Requirements

- Require Python packages in `requirements.txt`.
- Require `doxygen`

## Build

1. Run doxygen:
   ```bash
   doxygen
   ```
2. Build sphinx:
   - Enter `doc` folder, and build the doc:
     ```bash
     sphinx-build -n -W --keep-going -b html . _build/
     ```
   - Use auto-build to get updates while writing the doc:
     ```bash
     sphinx-autobuild -n -W -b html . _build/ --port 8001
     ```

## Notes

- When doing cross-referencing between different files, use the anchor generated in markdown. Don't use the anchor shown
  in the browser. The Anchor slug used in furo (sphinx theme) after built (in browser) and the one used in myst markdown
  are not the same!
